## This is a project for experiments with GAN's
* ##### Pytorch implementation
* ##### Gan's are trained on toy datasets: gaussian grid, gaussian circle, gaussian spiral
* ##### There are spectral normalization and gradient penalty options with different loss configurations 
* ##### Implemented WGAN-div, LSGAN, original GAN and relativistic GAN
* ##### Also there is code for visualizing gan training
Explore ./src/toygan.py for more details
